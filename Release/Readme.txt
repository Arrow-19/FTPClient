Hi there!
Just wanted to let you know that the files in the Release folder would be adequate to run this application.
But this application is made to run on my FTP server on my PC. 

If you want to tailor this application to run on your FTP server you would need to make a slight change in the source code of the application and rebuild the application. 
In line number 74 on the Form1.cs file you are required to enter the IP address of your FTP server. 
You would need to manually configure your own FTP server address and rebuild the application to get it working to your specific FTP server. 

Have a nice day! :)
